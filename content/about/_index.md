I am a Senior Research Scientist at MediaTek Research, working on large language models, deep reinforcement learning in chip design, diffusion models, speech processing, and representation learning with publications at ICML, EACL, ASRU.

With a team of talented researchers, I co-created and productized [BreeXe](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MediaTek-Research/Demo-MR-Breexe-8x7B), a commercialized LLM beating GPT3.5 on both knowledge and chat capabilities in Traditional Chinese, and opensourced [Breeze](https://huggingface.co/MediaTek-Research/Breeze-7B-Instruct-v1_0), a 7B LM with >11k downloads, for supporting research and entrepreneural efforts in LLMs in Traditional Chinese speaking communities.
